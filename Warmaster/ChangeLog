 ** Current Version: 1.2b **

i Scenarios done: 16(+02)/16

Version 1.2b  : * Raised the basic income at scenario 15 by 15. Now you should really be able to
                  keep yourself out of the red numbers.
                ! One message in scenario 10 wasn't shown because I accidently entered the wrong
                  name for the speaker (Delfador... Tsts...). This is now fixed.

Version 1.2   : * Raised the standard-starting gold in scenario 15 significantly since it is
                  likely that the player runs out of gold until that scenario and isn't able
                  to beat it then.
                ! The recall list should no longer vanish at the beginning of "Helping Elves".
                  (Just because the WML seemed to dislike the way I added the starting elves to
                   the scenario... So I'm doing it another way now. Although I can't guarantee
                   that this bug really is fixed now it didn't happen again to me yet, so I
                   guess it is.)
                * Made Igor a bit stronger and gave him a ranged weapon to make him stronger than
                  a normal royal guard and to make him an a bit greater threat to his enemies.
                + Added two additional guards for Groud to make it harder for the orcs to enter
                  the castle and kill the player.
                ! Ehehe. Blame me. Gwoddroy in scenario 04 is now really named "Gwoddroy"...

Version 1.1   : * Raised the turn limit at "Darkness Everywhere" by 15.
                * Raised the turn limit at "Volcano" by 4.
                - Removed the two one-hex villages in the beginning scenario that made the
                  ogre-leader almost impossible to defeat in some situations.
                * Made Groud weaker. He also is an important target for the enemies now.
                  (To make the beginning battle a bit more important)
                * Reduced the starting gold of the enemies in "Darkness Everywhere" by 50% and
                  gave them more income instead. This should prevent the caves from being empty
                  all the time. It should also prevent the player from being overwhelmed by a
                  gigantic wave of trolls all at once.
                * Changed gold/income of the enemies in scenario 15.
                + Added/improved text in the later scenarios a lot
                * Some other minor balancement changes

Version 1.0   : * Made Troy-boy at novice-level a bit more resilient.
				! Removed the death-traps in scenario 11 because they were buggy
					(Though having added a filter that should prevent flying units from
					being killed by the trap it did kill them).
				+ Added a little label in scenario 04 that shows where you can get the
					allowance.
				* Changed monster-units available in scenario 01 mostly to level-0-ones
					to keep them from blocking the path with their ZOC all the time.
				+ Added this changelog.
				+ Added a small treasure in scenario 07 to prevent the player from running
					out of money just because of being a bit unlucky
				* Lowered the XP Troy needs to gain a level

Version 0.6   : i First but incomplete release. Yet done: 11(+02)/16 Scenarios.
